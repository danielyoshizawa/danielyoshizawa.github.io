title: "What is development for me"
---

For a while I thought about writing a blog about development and anything related to it, the first monster that appeared
 for me to battle was, "What is development?". This question stayed in my mind since the beginning of times, at least my
 time as a developer.
 On the begining development was just type some code and see what was plot on the black screen of my cp400,
 actually it was my fathers computer, I don' know if he ever used it or just bought because it would became the future.
 I don't remember how I learned basic, I think a friend of my mom teach me how to use print or something like this, at that time
 print was my whole knowledge about software development.
 After a while I had contact with C/C++ through a friend, or it was visual basic, I don't remember, but the fact is, at that time
 I improved a little bit on this world, was like a total new world of infinit possibilities but the only thing that I knew how to do
 was to create a dialog and make the ok button runaway from the mouse cursor, it was very silly, I was 13, that explains a lot.
 From there beyond, I start to get more interested in this, it was the begining of the internet, static pages, geocities, aol,
 dialup connections, warcraft, so why not, I start to learn about HTML and created a Dragon Ball Z website, my mom was so proud
 of her little future Bill Gates, or something, sorry mom but not even close, it was just images that I gathered from other sites
 with a couple of texts that I also copied from other sites, more like a thief than anything else.
 After the milenium bug, or before, who knows, I asked my father for a C++ book, we weren't in the best financial shape and development
 books at that time were expensive, and he asked me, will you really read this book? I told him, of course I will, someday I will be a
 great developer and became milionarie, sorry dad, I break 2 promisses that I did, I didn't read the book neither became milionarie,
 but is not all of that lost, I became a C++ developer, very annoying one, and read a lot of development books, so I think its count for something.
 What else we have in this world? What I want? What I have to accomplishe? What does life reserves to me? Well, I was 17 and had to decide
 what I would do for the rest of my life, the fuking rest of my life, it is very unfair, I didn't even knew what life is, acctually I don't know yet.
 So computer engineer seems a resanable start point, oh I forgot, my father is an eletrical engineer, and for a long time he tought me how
 to do simple stuff like turn a led on, disasembly eletronic stuff, and try to reassembly, never worked, also my mother tired of wasting money
 fixing my computer that I constantly broke trying to learn how it works or trying to make "imporviments", put me in some computer maintancce class,
 well at least we never paid someone to fix our computer anymore. Where were we? oh yes, yes, computer engineer, I thought that it was everything that
 I had dreamed of, with this I would became the milionarie that I promisse my dad, be the new Bill Gates that my mom dreamed of, but how?
 First get into a university, not so easy, but I did, first class of computer engineer at the best technologic university of the south of the country,
 amazing, isn't? Well not so much, first week a teacher told us that we would never work as computer engineers in my country, we would be eletrical engineers
 or computer scientists, he was right for most of us, not for me, I dropout a few years later for a lot of reasons but got a lot of great lessons
 from this experience, learned java, c/c++, data structure, embended systems, math, calculus, physics, phylosophy, politics, drink, party,
 money management, cooking, were great years, but I wasn't sure what development is neither if it is what I would do for the rest of my life.
 After that I moved to the magic island to follow a dream, pay my bills, seriously, I couldn't ask my parents to support me anymore,
 I had to start to walk with my on hands, or feet, wasn't sure at the time, so the only thing that I could fake that I was at least almost
 ok at was development, and in a bar talk with friends this C++ opportunity show in a divine light for me, well time to fix my resume
 and take a shot, so I hit, when I got the interview I was desperated because my knowledge in anything was so limited, I had work on a couple of
 great places before, like COPEL, HSBC, GLT-HSBC, using a lot of technologies and had learnt a lot of things, but I couldn't consider myself
 a developer, so I had to learn the most in no time to at least have something to talk in the interview, in 10 days I read the Deitel's C++ book,
 more than a thousand pages, Design Patterns from the gang of four and other book that I don't remember, well at least I had something to talk about.
 I got the job, was a C++ developer trainee position, let me explain the trainee part, they knew that I had no idea what was going on so they gave
 me an opportunity to start, in no time I evolved to C++ developer level 1, was less then 3 months for this to happen,
